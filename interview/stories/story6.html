	<p id="quote">I'm motivated for my dream. Back when I first dreamed to become a fashion designer, I didn't have specific reason other than the fact that I loved dressing up and wearing what looked "nice". Then, I started to learn that fashion isn't just garments to look "cool" but it represents an identity of a person- from simple things such as what brand one likes to something more complicated such as what particular outfits reflect about the person. This idea came from a crisis that I went through in freshmen year of high school when I was bullied and called upon by a sophomore. He called me gay because I was wearing skinny jeans. I do not have anything against homosexuals; dont get me wrong. But back then, for someone who just moved to a new school and wanted to fit in started to fall in a crisis where he had to choose whether to wear what he wants or hide his real identity and "fit in" to the "normal/cool" group. After weeks of those hardships, I came to conclusion that I would rather wear something that I want to wear to portray who I am rather than to care about stranger's ideas. So, here I am, a simple guy who wants to keep things simple with less issues in his life. I want to become a designer who let people portray who they are through garments created by their own original ideas.</p>
