	<p id="quote">I took a semester off of college and moved to Los Angeles. This decision was totally spur of the moment, and yes, my parents were furious with me. I visited my bestfriend at her college, Northridge, during my winter break. I was at a point in my life where I got out of a bad, messy breakup and didn't have much emotional support as I had wished, I felt like I just wanted to escape and numb my feelings. So, when I visited my bestfriend, I could have sworn, it's like I had a breathe of fresh air from life. The sunsets were different, the air was sweeter, I felt like I got my radiance back just within that short time of being out of the Bay Area. The day before I flew back home was like 10 days before school started. I expressed to my friends in LA that I was dreading to go back to the same gray life I was living. I cried for so long and eventually postponed my flight to 4 days before the first day of school. The day of my flight, something came over me and I realized I need to do what makes me happy, and accept that it's okay to feel how I feel. I knew I had to do what was best for me and my well-being. Honestly I did feel like wanting to drop out of college and say f*** it, but I came to my senses and realized I just needed a break. I called my parents and explained to them how I felt, they didn't agree with it but they understood my pain. That day I went back to the Bay Area, packed up my stuff, and came back to LA after a few days. I was able to rebuild my mental health and find a deeper value of happiness, true happiness, in my life.
